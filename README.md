Simple quiz game.

Answer four questions, every wrong answer time is docked from remaining time. 

You start with 75 seconds. Every wrong answer deducts 15 seconds from the time remaining.

At the end of the quiz, it will prompt you to enter your initials.

It should save the initials and highscore to a list. I have been unsuccessful in getting this to work so far.

I will make the appropriate updates with some feedback after grading. I really struggled with that last bit.
